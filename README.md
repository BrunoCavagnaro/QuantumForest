# QuantumForest

QuantumForest is a new lib on the model of differentiable decision trees. It has the advantages of both trees and neural networks. Experiments on large datasets show that QuantumForest has higher accuracy than both deep networks and best GBDT libs(XGBoost, Catboost, mGBDT,...). 

- Keeping **simple tree structure**，easy to use and explain the decision process 
- **Full differentiability** like neural networks. So we could train it with many powerful optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, …), just like the training of deep CNN.
-  Support **batch training** to reduce the memory usage greatly.
-  Support the **end-to-end learning** mode. No more work to preprocess data.
